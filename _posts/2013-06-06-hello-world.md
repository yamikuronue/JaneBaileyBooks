Hello out there! This is Jane Bailey, reporting live on the breathtaking new design of my brand new website!

Not that I’m anything like an impartial observer, of course, seeing as how I put together the site and all the content on it, and personally administer the server it’s running on. But a girl can dream, right?

I figured I’d take this opportunity to lay out exactly what this blog is going to be and what it won’t. First and foremost, it’s not going to be my personal blog; that’s already hosted elsewhere on the interwebs. This blog is about my writing, primarily for promotional purposes. If you want to know what’s going on in the professional life of Jane Bailey, Self-published Urban Fantasy author, this is the place for you. If you want to know about my steampunk costuming, or my day-to-day-life, or my dayjob as a computer programmer, you’re going to be disappointed.

This blog is also not going to sport frequent updates. It will get posts when there’s news, but there may be weeks or months with nothing much going on in my authorial life. As I alluded to earlier, this is not my primary or fulltime job at this point in time, so I only have so many hours in a day to devote to it. If I take off and develop a huge fanbase, that’ll change, but for now, this is not going to be a very high-priority blog for me. At least I won’t be blathering on about nothing to fill space, right?
