Greetings, readers! Want to support my writing and don't know how? Just want to have some fun online on a Saturday? I'm having a launch party on Twitch for my brand new [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/JaneBailey)! 

The party is on [my twitch channel](http://www.twitch.com/yamikuronue) at 1pm on Saturday, June 11th; for more information, you can check out [the facebook page for the event](https://www.facebook.com/events/130324717380801/). It should be really fun; there will be games, good company, and even some giveaways. 

Hope to see you there!
