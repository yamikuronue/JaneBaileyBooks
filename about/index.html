    Jane Bailey is a self-published author of urban fantasy novels as well as a part-time blogger and regular participant of Nanowrimo. Born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, she spent a year in England before settling down in Northeast Ohio. She began writing fanfiction and poetry at a young age, eventually settling into the urban fantasy genre, where she feels she can blend her travel experiences with a touch of magic. Her biggest inspirations in the genre are Jim Butcher, Seanen MacGuire, Eileen Wilks, and early Laurell K Hamilton; however, she owes much of her love of fantasy in general to Tamora Pierce, who inspired her at an early age to keep searching for women in fiction.
