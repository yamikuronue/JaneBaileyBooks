    Jane Bailey (they/them) is a self-published author of urban fantasy novels as well as a part-time blogger and regular participant of Nanowrimo. Born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, they spent a year in England before settling down in Northeast Ohio. They began writing fanfiction and poetry at a young age, eventually settling into the urban fantasy genre, where they feel they can blend their travel experiences with a touch of magic. Their biggest inspirations in the genre are Jim Butcher, Seanen MacGuire, Eileen Wilks, and early Laurell K Hamilton; however, they owe much of their love of fantasy in general to Tamora Pierce, who inspired them at an early age to keep searching for women and nonbinary folks in fiction.
